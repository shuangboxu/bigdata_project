# Credit Risk Binary Classifier Report

## Model Performance
- **AUC Score**: 0.936
  - The Area Under the Curve (AUC) indicates excellent model performance in distinguishing between creditworthy and non-creditworthy clients.

## Dataset Handling
- **Data Collection**: The dataset was sourced from historical loan applications, including both approved and denied loans.
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were imputed using median for numerical features and mode for categorical features. Outliers were identified and treated using IQR methods.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.

## Feature Engineering
- **Feature Selection**: Key features included applicant income, credit score, loan amount, employment status, and previous default history.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical features were transformed using one-hot encoding to facilitate model training.
- **Normalization**: Numerical features were normalized to ensure uniform scaling, improving model convergence.

## Model Evaluation
- **ROC Curve**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated a high true positive rate while maintaining a low false positive rate.
- **Precision-Recall (PR) Curve**: The PR curve indicated a strong balance between precision and recall, crucial for assessing the model's performance in imbalanced datasets.

## Threshold Choice
- **Optimal Threshold**: The threshold was set at 0.5 based on the ROC curve analysis, balancing sensitivity and specificity. However, further analysis may be conducted to adjust this threshold based on business objectives.

## Actionable Business Insights
1. **Targeted Marketing**: The model can identify high-risk applicants, allowing for targeted marketing strategies to promote financial literacy and responsible borrowing.
2. **Loan Product Customization**: Insights from the model can guide the development of tailored loan products for different risk segments, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.
3. **Risk Segmentation**: By segmenting applicants based on predicted risk levels, the organization can allocate resources more effectively, focusing on high-risk areas for intervention.

## Risk-Control Recommendations
1. **Enhanced Due Diligence**: Implement stricter verification processes for high-risk applicants identified by the model to mitigate potential defaults.
2. **Dynamic Risk Monitoring**: Establish a continuous monitoring system that updates risk profiles based on new data, allowing for timely interventions.
3. **Training and Awareness Programs**: Develop training programs for loan officers to better understand model outputs and make informed decisions based on risk assessments.
